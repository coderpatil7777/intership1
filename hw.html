        <mark><b>Chhatarpati Shivaji Maharaj</b></mark>  
         was one of the greatest and most courageous 
        rulers in Indian history. <u>He was born on 19th February 1630 at Shivneri Fort near Junnar
         in Pune district, Maharashtra. His father, Shahaji Bhosale, was a Maratha general, and 
         his mother, Jijabai,</u> was a deeply religious and brave woman who inspired Shivaji with 
         stories from the Ramayana and Mahabharata. From a young age, Shivaji showed signs of 
         leadership, bravery, and a vision for an independent Hindu kingdom.
        At the age of 16, he captured the Torna Fort, marking the beginning of his fight for 
        Swarajya (self-rule). He used smart military tactics known as guerrilla warfare or
         Ganimi Kava, which allowed him to defeat much larger armies using surprise attacks 
         and knowledge of terrain. He gradually captured several forts and regions and laid
          the foundation of the Maratha Empire.
        On 6th June 1674, Shivaji Maharaj was formally crowned as the Chhatrapati at Raigad Fort.
        He was not only a brave warrior but also an excellent administrator. He set up a strong central
        government and appointed the Ashta Pradhan Mandal, a council of eight ministers, to manage various
         departments of the kingdom like justice, finance, internal security, foreign affairs, and more. He
          promoted agriculture, trade, and respected all religions. Though a devout Hindu, Shivaji Maharaj
           never forced religion upon anyone and always protected women and places of worship during wars.
         He fought many battles against powerful enemies like the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, the Bijapur 
         Sultanate, and European powers such as the Portuguese and British. He understood the importance 
         of naval power and built a strong navy to protect the Konkan coast, making him one of the first Indian kings to do so.
        Shivaji Maharaj captured more than 350 forts, including famous ones like Raigad, Rajgad, Torna, 
        Pratapgad, and Sinhagad. His rule was just and people-friendly. He is remembered not only as a warrior
         but also as a king who cared for his people and established a strong foundation for the Maratha Empire,
          which later became one of the most powerful forces in India.
        He passed away on 3rd April 1680 at Raigad Fort. However, his legacy continues to live on. Shivaji Maharaj
         is a symbol of bravery, pride, leadership, and nationalism. He inspired generations of freedom fighters 
         and continues to be deeply respected and loved by the people of India. Statues, museums, roads, airports,
          and institutions across the country are named in his honor, and a grand memorial statue called Shiv Smarak 
          is being built in the Arabian Sea near Mumbai to celebrate his legacy.

        <mark>Tanaji Malusare</mark> was a brave and <b>loyal commander of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.</b>
         He was from Umrathe village in the Maval region and was a close childhood 
         friend of Shivaji. In 1670, despite being busy with his sons wedding 
         preparations, Tanaji chose to lead the battle to capture Kondhana Fort
          (now Sinhagad). He climbed the fort at night using a monitor lizard (ghorpad)
           and fought valiantly against the Mughal forces. Though the Marathas won the 
           fort, Tanaji was martyred in the battle. Upon hearing the news, Shivaji Maharaj
            sadly said, “The fort is won, but the lion is lost.” In honor of his bravery,
            Kondhana was renamed as Sinhagad. Tanaji remains a symbol of courage, 
            sacrifice, and dedication to the Maratha Empire.

        <mark>Baji Prabhu Deshpande</mark> was one of the most loyal and brave generals of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. 
        He is best remembered for his heroic role in the Battle of Pavan Khind in 1660. 
        When Shivaji Maharaj was trapped by the forces of the Adilshahi general Siddi Jauhar at Panhala 
        Fort, a secret escape plan was executed. 
        Shivaji Maharaj decided to break through the enemys siege and head toward Vishalgad Fort. 
        To ensure his safe passage, Baji Prabhu volunteered to stay back with about 300 select
        soldiers (Mavalas) and delay the pursuing army in the narrow mountain pass now known as Pavan Khind.
        Despite being heavily outnumbered, Baji Prabhu and his men fought fiercely against thousands 
        of Adilshahi troops. He kept fighting with unmatched courage even after being grievously injured. 
        Baji Prabhu had taken a vow that he would continue the battle until he heard the sound of cannon 
        fire from Vishalgad, which would signal that Shivaji Maharaj had reached safely. True to his word, 
        he fought till his last breath and attained martyrdom, but not before ensuring the safety of his king 
        and the mission.
        His sacrifice made him a symbol of valor, loyalty, and patriotism in Maratha history. 
        The pass where the battle took place was named "Pavan Khind" ("Sacred Pass") in honor of his
